Cherrio. My name is Lea and this is my webpage where I talk about about me and give you information about Sci-Fi conventions
and let you take a glimpse of my favorite shows. Well long story short, I am a veteran and have been out of the Army since July 2011. I wanted a change of scenery from the war and still felt 
like I had a lot to learn in the "tech" field; so once I fullfilled my obligation, I decide to head back to the state of Florida to pursue my education.The following semester I enrolled and just this past semester
graduated from St. Pete College,(which is located in the well established city of St. Petersburg, Florida), and made the most regrettable decision of transferring 
to Florida Gulf Coast University, (which is located in a less established "boring" Ft. Myers, Florida. Now that I am here, I will will make the best of a bad decision, and hope to leave this
forsaken place with a degree ready to conqure the world. LOL!Although there isn't much to do here, I do have a few hobbies that have become moreso, an obsession: 
<br>
<br>
1)Getting the latest body art to join my collection
<br>
<br>
2)Watching reruns of my favorite SCi-Fi telly shows and movies
