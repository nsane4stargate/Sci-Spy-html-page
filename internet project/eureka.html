<text align="left"><font size="3">Eureka is an American science fiction television series that premiered on Syfy on 
July 18, 2006. The fifth and final season ended on July 16, 2012. The show is set in a fictional town in Oregon called Eureka
(although, in the pilot episode, Eureka was located in Washington State). Inhabited almost entirely by scientific geniuses, most residents 
of Eureka work for Global Dynamics—an advanced research facility responsible for the development of nearly all major technological breakthroughs 
since its inception. Each episode features a mysterious accidental or intentional misuse of technology, which the town sheriff, Jack Carter,
then solves with the help of town scientists. Each season also features a larger story arc that concerns a particular major event or item.</text>
